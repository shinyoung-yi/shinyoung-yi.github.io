Developing comprehensive lecture materials on physics-based rendering. These materials are the first
Python-based rendering lecture sources utilizing Mitsuba 3, a popular research-oriented rendering
system. Compared to existing materials based on heavy C++ implementations, the Python interface significantly enhances accessibility, enabling researchers in fields beyond computer graphics, such as computer
vision and remote sensing, to effectively learn rendering concepts
